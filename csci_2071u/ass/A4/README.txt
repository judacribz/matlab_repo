The Lag.m file contains the script to plot the function and the interpolant and a separte plot of the interpolation error.
1a-function_and_interpolant.fig and 1a-interpolant_error show the plots required for questions 1a.

For LSF.m, where it asks for comparing the polynomial to f on a fine grid, I only plotted 10 of comparisons because of 
space limitation.
